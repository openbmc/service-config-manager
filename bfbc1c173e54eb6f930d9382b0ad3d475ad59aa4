      "message": "Probably can add this line to make it more explicit:\nmeson_version: \u0027\u003e\u003d0.57.0\u0027,\n\nThe reason for using .57 is that C++20 requires it and the openbmc CI will look for this if the C++ version is set to to C++20. As an extra credit, you could update it with this commit and change the cpp_std from c++17 in line 7 above to c++20 which is now the recommended c++ level in openbmc.\n\nYour commit title would then be \"switch to c++20 and meson \u003e\u003d0.57.0\", something like that.",
