I added a version.\n\n\u003e I\u0027ll reiterate that I\u0027d really like to see this file be written as systemd units, so systemd is aware of the changes, we don\u0027t get mismatches, and things like systemctl disable still function.

I wouldn\u0027t object to an addition later where this application monitored for systemd changes to the unit files and updated these persistent files.",
