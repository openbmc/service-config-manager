# Service config manager

The service config manager provides a D-Bus interface to manage BMC services as
described by the [service management D-Bus interfaces][].

The configuration settings are intended to persist across BMC reboots.

An example use case for this service is [BMCWeb's
implementation][bmcweb-implementation] of the Redfish NetworkProtocol schema.

## Design

Implementation details are described in the [D-Bus interface README].

The service config manager generally makes configuration changes to `systemd`
units via D-Bus interfaces.

The design pattern to add new services or controls is:

- Determine if the service you want to control is socket activated.
- To control the `Running` and `Enabled` properties of a service:
  - For a service which uses socket activation, control the socket.
  - For other services, control the service unit itself.
