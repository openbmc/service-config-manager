      "message": "Hmm, that\u0027s a good point. nlohmann is pretty small but we shouldn\u0027t include it if we don\u0027t have the feature enabled. I think with the cereal includes I was just simplifying since we always use it for the main file, but still best to keep that wrapped as well with the compile option.",
