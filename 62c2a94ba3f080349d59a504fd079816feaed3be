      "message": "These commands functionally just use symlinks on the systemd service files;  Could we track the state in a similar way so we\u0027re not inventing a different file format?\n\nI could see a case where someone disables a service, then reboots, expecting the service to be enabled, but srvcfg-mgr has persisted the opposite, so the service reenables.  That seems like worse unexpected behavior.",

      "message": "Ahh interesting perspective. For me, it\u0027s the opposite. We have the formal REST API for enabling/disabling services (which goes through the official d-bus API\u0027s into service-config-manager). To me that is the source of truth. If we have a product engineer (or developer in the lab) mucking around on a system using systemctl and other command line mechanisms to debug something, I want the system to go back to the source of truth after a BMC reboot.\n\nMy proposal here is a change in behavior though so I understand if the preference here is that I enable this new \"persistence\" feature via a meson build option.",

      "message": "The way I always thought of this service was that this was just adding \"easy buttons\" to dbus but systemd was always the source of truth for whether a service was enabled/disabled.  The REST API should directly reflect the same thing as systemd status, although indirectly through this service so it can track some amount of intent (is this service disabled, or is this service crashed).",
