I suspect that any invalid or corrupted JSON file you really desire to have it come down to this path so that the whole JSON can be re-written?\n\nShould we add some kind of catch on line 164-166 so that any invalid json sets the \"updateRequired\" field?",

      "message": "A system crash in the middle of writing the file could be one cause of that.  The fs journal had \"create file\" or \"truncate file\" listed in the journal, but the data didn\u0027t make it out yet.  Depending on how big this file is, the moment you span an erase block (or sector in eMMC), you could end up with a partial file which will leave you in the same boat.",
